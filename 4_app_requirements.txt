I want to develop an app called PlaneFinder that uses the FlightAware 
API to access live airplane data. The app will initially offer two features:

1. Flight Search by Aircraft Type: 
Users can input an aircraft type into a search box, such as "B788," 
to view all corresponding flights currently in the air. 
The results will display in a grid showing aircraft type, date, origin, 
destination, total distance, flight time, 
remaining time, and airline.

2. Flight Search by Carrier: A second search box allows users to search by airline, 
returning a grid with all aircraft currently in the air for that carrier, 
along with the count of each aircraft type. For example, 
it might show that Delta Airlines has 57 B757s, 10 B717s, and 5 A359s currently flying.
