# PlaneFinder MVP Masterplan

## App Overview and Objectives

PlaneFinder is a web application designed to retrieve and display live airplane data using the FlightAware API. The primary objectives are:

1. Allow users to search for active flights by aircraft type
2. Enable users to search for all flights currently in the air by a specific airline
3. Provide a simple, user-friendly interface for aviation enthusiasts

## Target Audience

- Travel enthusiasts
- Aviation hobbyists

## Core Features and Functionality

1. Search by Aircraft Type:
   - Input: Aircraft model (e.g., "B788")
   - Output: Grid display of all active flights for the specified aircraft type, including:
     - Aircraft type
     - Flight date
     - Origin and destination airports
     - Total flight distance
     - Flight time
     - Remaining time to destination
     - Airline

2. Search by Airline:
   - Input: Airline name
   - Output: Grid display of all aircraft currently in the air for the specified airline, including:
     - Count of each aircraft type (e.g., "57 flights with B757")

3. Data Refresh:
   - Automatic refresh of flight data every 5 minutes

## High-level Technical Stack Recommendations

- Frontend: Next.js with React
- Backend: Next.js API routes
- Database: SQLite
- Styling: Tailwind CSS
- API Integration: FlightAware API

## Conceptual Data Model

```
Flights
- id (primary key)
- aircraft_type
- flight_date
- origin_airport
- destination_airport
- total_distance
- flight_time
- remaining_time
- airline
- last_updated

Airlines
- id (primary key)
- name
- flights_count
- last_updated
```

## User Interface Design Principles

- Minimalist design
- Clear and intuitive search interfaces
- Responsive grid layouts for displaying flight information
- Easily scannable data presentation

## Security Considerations

- Store FlightAware API key in environment variables
- Implement rate limiting on API routes to prevent abuse
- Sanitize user inputs to prevent SQL injection and XSS attacks

## Development Phases

1. Setup and Configuration
   - Set up Next.js project
   - Configure Tailwind CSS
   - Set up SQLite database

2. API Integration
   - Implement FlightAware API integration
   - Create data fetching and storage logic

3. Backend Development
   - Develop API routes for search functionality
   - Implement data refresh mechanism

4. Frontend Development
   - Create search interfaces
   - Develop results display components
   - Implement responsive design

5. Testing and Refinement
   - Conduct thorough testing of all features
   - Refine UI/UX based on initial usage

## Potential Challenges and Solutions

1. Challenge: Handling large amounts of real-time data
   Solution: Implement efficient data storage and retrieval methods, consider pagination for large result sets

2. Challenge: API rate limits
   Solution: Implement proper error handling and display cached data if API is unavailable

3. Challenge: Ensuring data accuracy
   Solution: Implement data validation checks and display last updated timestamp

## Future Expansion Possibilities

1. User accounts for saving favorite searches
2. Map view for visualizing flight paths
3. Real-time notifications for specific flights
4. Historical data analysis and trends
5. Mobile app development
6. Integration with additional flight data sources

This masterplan provides a high-level overview of the PlaneFinder MVP. As development progresses, certain aspects may need to be adjusted based on specific implementation challenges or changing requirements.
